# About Me
Hello, I'm Sylv! I enjoy programming, game development, Minecraft modding, math, physics, history, and the arts.

## About This Place
I've mostly demolished my pevious website because it was rather unprofessional (and rather unreasonable for a non-LGBTQIA+ person to understand).
However, I am a furry and trans, yes, and I will not hide that.

I do believe it is rather unfortunate that I chose `sylv.gay` and not, say, `sylv12345.net`, because it most certainly sounds like the kind of domain
name a scammer would use, but it's what I've been using for two years, and that's something I can't really change at this point.
